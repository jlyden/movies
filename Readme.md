##Extra Credit Description
Added IMDb links dropdown menu to navbar. I initially put these links beneath each movie picture, but when you clicked the IMDb link, the movie trailer also opened. So I moved those links to navbar. 
I also added minor CSS styling - background color, font family, size and weight. I'd do more, but I want to move on to the next project!
